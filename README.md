#### Sample Code
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the main game loop:

            def main():
                """Main function to start the game."""
                print_welcome_message()

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                main()


### Example Usage
After starting the game, you'll be asked for your name and whether you're ready to board the plane.
If you choose to board, the adventure begins with the plane crashing and you being stranded on an island.
You'll be presented with various scenarios and must choose your actions wisely to survive.

### Images and Scenes
The game uses images and scenes from the images and scenes modules.
Make sure these modules are included in your project directory.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/island-survival-game.git
    cd island-survival-game
    ```

2. Install any required packages (if applicable):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Game

Run the main Python file to start the game:

```bash
python main.py


## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
