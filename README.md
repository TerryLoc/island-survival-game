## [Introduction](#introduction)

The **Island Survival Game** is a text-based adventure game where you must make the right choices to survive on a deserted island. Your choices will determine your fate, so choose wisely! The game is built with Python and is played in the terminal.

### Target Audience
The game is suitable for anyone who enjoys text-based adventure games and wants to test their decision-making skills. It's a fun and interactive way to experience a survival scenario and see if you can make it out alive.

#### User Stories
1. As a player, I want to be able to make choices that affect the outcome of the game.
2. As a player, I want to experience different scenarios based on my choices.
3. As a player, I want to be able to play the game multiple times with different outcomes.

## [How to Play](#how-to-play)

To play the **Island Survival Game**, follow these steps: 
It is a simple game that can be played by anyone. I wanted to create a game that was easy to play and understand.

The game is built with a multiple-choice format:
1. You will be given a scenario and you choose from a list of options.
2. Use numbers to enter your option (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4).
3. You will be presented with a new scenario based on your choice.
4. Make the right choices to survive and escape the island.

### Game layout

The game is structured as follows:

1. Welcome message and game rules where the user is prompted to enter their name and asked if they are ready to board the plane.

<br>

2. The game starts with the plane crashing and you being stranded on an island. You will be presented with the first event scenario. The time of day will determine on the random library used in the first_event() function. Here they can choose to explore the island or stay put.

<br>

3. Based on your choice, you will be presented with the second event scenario. Unless it was night time, you will be presented with the choices to explore the island or stay put. If you choose to explore at night instead of staying put you will lose...

<br>

4. After playing through the game you will be presented with the option to play again or exit the game. This will loop back to the start of the game. If you choose to exit the game you will be presented with a goodbye message.

<br>

The game is built with a modular structure to handle different scenarios and outcomes. Here's an overview of all the functions in the game:

### Main Functions
1.  **print_welcome_message()**: Displays the welcome message and game rules.
2.  **get_user_name()**: Prompts the user for their name and initiates the boarding process.
3.  **initiate_boarding(user_name)**: Handles the boarding process and starts the first event.
4.  **exit_game()**: Exit the game with a goodbye message if player does not board the plane.
5.  **play_again()**: Prompts the user to play again or exit the game.
6.  **get_numeric_choice(prompt)**: Prompts the user for a numeric input and validates it.
7.  **first_event()**: Determines the time of day and presents the first event scenario.
8.  **second_event(day_night)**: Presents the second event scenario based on the user's choice.
9.  **handle_scenarios(day_night, user_choice, movements)**: Handles scenarios based on the user's choice.
10. **beach()**: Handles the random outcome on returning to the beach.
11. **choices(day_info, print_choices)**: Prints the choices based on it being daytime.
12. **choices_outcomes(day_info, print_choices)**: Prints the choices based on the outcome decision of the user.
13. **handle_stay_put_scenario()**: Handles the scenario when the user chooses to stay put.
14. **main()**: The main function to start the game.

#### Sample Code
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the main game loop:

            def main():
                """Main function to start the game."""
                print_welcome_message()

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                main()

### Example of the Game
After starting the game, you'll be asked for your name and whether you're ready to board the plane.
If you choose to board, the adventure begins with the plane crashing and you being stranded on an island.
You'll be presented with various scenarios and must choose your actions wisely to survive.

#### User Options
The game provides the user with a list of options to choose from. Here are some examples:
<img src="images/choices.png" alt="User options" width="400px" margin=" 0 auto"/>

#### Game Over
If you make the wrong choices, you may face a game over scenario. Here's an example:
<img src="images/playagain.png" alt="Start again" width="400px" margin=" 0 auto"/>

### Time breaks 
To ensure better user experience, the game us the time library. This allows the game to load the next scene with a bit of anticipation, and ensures a better flow and readability.

### Images and Scenes
The game uses these two modules (images.py & scenes.py) to get the information needed to display the outcome of the users choices.

 ## [Deployment](#deployment)

The game is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://island-survival-game-677f52a3b93d.herokuapp.com/).

To deploy the game on Heroku, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) website.
2. Create or log in to your account.
3. On your dashboard:
   - If you don't have any projects created yet, there should be a "Create a new app" prompt in the middle of the screen.
   - If you have some projects already, click on the "New" tab on the top right corner of the screen just below the profile bauble. 
4. Enter a unique application name for your project and select the region you are based in. Click "create app".
5. Once inside the app, select "Settings" button from the menu in the middle. It's important to edit the "Settings" tab before deploying the project: 
    1. Click on "Reveal Config Vars" and enter the following:
        - If you are using any APIs you will need to copy paste your creds.json details:
            - In the "key" box type "CREDS". 
            - In the "value" box copy the contents of your creds.json file: 
            - Click "Add".

        - type in PORT to the "key" box, and 8000 to the "value" box:
            - click "Add".

    2. Add Buildpacks below Config Vars. Click on "Add buildpack":

        - First, select Python and click "Add buildpack".
        - Second, select node.js and click "Add buildpack".
        
    **Note:** Python has to be listed first (at the top) of the two packs.

6. Once step 5 is done, navigate to the "Deploy" tab a the top of the screen to the left of where the Settings tab is located.
7. Click on "Github" icon under "Deployment method", and connect Heroku to your Github account. 
8. Once the accounts are connected you can choose between automatic or manual deployment:

    - Automatic deployment will automatically update your app once you use "git push" command in  your IDE. 
    - Manual deployment will require you to manually "push" the changes you made in the IDE to the Heroku system.
